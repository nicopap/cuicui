/// Stores the styles used when parsing format strings.

/// Styles are transformation operations on the parse tree of the format strings.
/// Check out the [`TransformedTree`] methods for an exhaustive list of what is
/// possible.
///
/// # Style transform operations
///
/// Transform operations currently only include `alias` and `chop`.
///
/// ## `alias`
///
/// `alias` let you translate a modifier
/// (the thingies to the left of the `|` in sections `{zoo: bee|whaboo}`)
/// into another set of modifiers (this can be **several** modifiers).
///
/// There are several ways of defining aliases. Either you can go ham and stringly
/// typed, and only manipulate text (the parsing will fail later if you generate invalid
/// code), or you directly return concrete modifier values.
///
/// Since a modifier always has a string value, you can even parametrize the
/// resulting modifiers on that value. See the [`TransformedTree::alias`]
/// documentation for details.
///
/// ## `chop`
///
/// `chop` operations let you designate a modifier name to use to **split**
/// sections either _by word_ or _by character_. Then insert an individual
/// modifier in each chopped section.
///
/// All pre-existing modifiers are extended to work on the split sections transparently.
/// Even subsections of the section with the `chop` modifier will be correctly handled.
/// It's honestly amazing this is even possible on a theoretical level.
///
/// The `chop` methods on [`TransformedTree`] always accept a `FnMut` that returns
/// a modifier. This `FnMut` will be called several times â€” once per created section.
/// You should return a different one per call.
///
/// For example, if you want to define a `Rainbow` modifier, you'd return a `HueShift`
/// modifier with a different amount of shift per section.
///
/// [`TransformedTree`] provides methods to make this a bit less error prone.
/// Relying on mutable state in a `FnMut` is always a bit tricky.
